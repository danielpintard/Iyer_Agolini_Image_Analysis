## Background

## Methods

- Started out with mainly exploring the image data and getting familiar with tools, methods and concepts that may be useful
- The main issue I've encountered so far is that the images have a unimodal distribution for their pixel intensities. This rules out options like Otsu's method for thresholding the images to get binary representations of the nuclei in an image. 
- Going forward, I know I need to use adaptive thresholding.
